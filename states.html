			State Website Reviews
		</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li> 
				<h3> <a href = "https://iowa.gov/" target = "_new"> Iowa</a> </h3>
				<p>
					This site is very visually appealing. Icons for links to other pages on the website will "jump" at you, which makes this site a little more lively than most of the other state websites. The site adjusts to different screen sizes and has an easy to understand navigation. The html code has several divs that have ids and classes, which is apparent in the well styled site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Summary: More interesting than their corn fields.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li> 
				<h3> <a href = "https://tn.gov/" target = "_new"> Tennesse</a> </h3>
				<p>
					The naviagtion bar stays at the top of the screen when you scroll down the page. This page is one of the more visually appealing state sites on this list. Nothing to noticable about the html code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Summary: Could be the focus of some rising country singer's first song after they run away to Nashville to fulfill their lifelong dream. However, you will probably never hear this singer on the radio.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li> 
				<h3> <a href = "https://vermont.gov/" target = "_new"> Vermont</a> </h3>
				<p>
					The site is again visually appealing, especially when compared to the next two sites. However, the image that the have on their home page took several seconds to load. The menu seems easy to understand and follows you as you scroll down. Again, nothing stands out too much in the html code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Summary: I don't know much about Vermont, but I guess that means their website is more interesting than their state.
				</p>
			</li>
		
			<li> 
				<h3><a href = "https://alaska.gov/" target = "_new"> Alaska</a></h3>
				<p>
					The first thing I noticed was that I had to scroll to the right if I wanted to see what was on that side of the page when the screen size was only half of my monitor. Overall, the site isn't very visually appealing to me and seems kind of dull and flat. The navigation of the site seems fairly easy to navigate, which is convenient for people who need to use it. The html code for the site seems to be well organized. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Summary: This site could be one of the reasons that people in Alaska continue to have seasonal depression into the spring months. Really need to liven up their website.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li> 
				<h3><a href = "https://oklahoma.gov/" target = "_new"> Oklahoma</a></h3>
				<p>
					The site does adjust to different screen sizes; however, when the screen is at half the monitor's normal size, it puts the content's into two different sections that you have to navigate between, which at first wasn't obvious to me. The navigation menu is not as obvious as some of the other sites. Their html code has a lot more comments that most of the other sites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Summary: You would think with all of the fracking the state does they could afford to put more into their website.
