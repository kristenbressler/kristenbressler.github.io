				<h1>Website Opinion Article</h1>
				<p>
					<a href = "https://apple.com/" target = "_new">Apple’s</a> website has a modern, minimalistic and sleek design that accurately represents the brand that the company would like to portray. The wording on the home page is minimal. Much of the home page is images of products that the company is selling, which allows consumers to easily find the pages that they are looking for. From a marketing standpoint, they advertise their main products well, as what are likely the products they would most like to sell are at the top of the page. Further down, smaller products are nicely formatted in a grid of photos. Each of the product photos can be clicked on and the user will be taken directly to the page of the product, which makes navigation quite simple.
				</p>

					The website is using HTML5 elements within the code. Several classes are used throughout the code. Classes seem to be used for things such as making columns and styling of things such as form selectors. JavaScript is also heavily used throughout the website and is likely responsible for much of the interactivity of many of the features in the website. The appearance and the additional ways in which the pages are interactive and allow the user to better understand the product are what really makes this website an exemplar.

					Another example of a good website would be <a href = "https://nike.com/" target = "_new">Nike’s</a>. Much like Apple’s website, this website has a clean design and mostly uses white and gray tones that give it a modern feel. The simplicity of the website’s colors also allows for their colorful products to stand out and draw in customers’ attentions. One interesting feature of this website is that the navigation items have dropdown menus that expand the entire screen. In doing this, Nike is able to better organize their products for each of their product categories.

					Not surprisingly, Nike’s website uses HTML5 elements. Again, much like Apple’s website, a rather larger number of JavaScript elements are also used. Nike also uses several div elements with classes that are responsible for their sleek design. Nike’s website is quite comparable to Apple’s and should be considered a good website because of its overall design that is result of their well done code.

					As for an example of a website that is subpar from what may be expected, we can look towards <a href = "https://nasa.gov/" target = "_new">NASA</a>. Overall, the appearance of NASA’s website looks a bit dated.  The background is simply black with the navigation bar seeming to have a black image with white stars as a background. Speaking of the navigation, many of the navigation sections have dropdown menus. This is a common feature, however, many, but not all, of the items in the navigation do not link to other pages of the websites. Instead, you must click on one of the subitems to go to a different page. It seems common to be able to move to a different page by clicking on a main navigation item on most websites, so I often found myself clicking on these and waiting for something to happen when nothing ever did.  Many of the pages on the website are laid out in a grid system of images. Unlike Apple’s website, which effectively used a picture grid system, NASA’s grid layout seems to change with different pages. Another ascetic flaw of the site is that it has a side menu that allows you to navigate to pages that are related to the one that you are currently on. This side menu has a scroll bar that is separate from the rest of the page, which isn’t very visually appealing.

					NASA’s site does use HTML5 elements, like the other two websites did. However, there are noticeably less elements in this website’s code. It is not as easy to understand what some of the classes that elements have are supposed to be doing, as they are not named in a way that could be easily interpreted, like the other websites had. The outdated and at times messy design, is what places this website several tiers below the first two.
